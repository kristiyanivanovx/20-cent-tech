# About the project
## 20 cent tech

This is a website which describes and shows my favorite technologies and specifically- those from the 20th century.
The project was part of my entry tests that I did successfully and that led to my reception in Vratsa Software Community's coding bootcamp.
The language used is the web app is Bulgarian.
Initially I used Materialize for the design.
Now I'm using React Bootstrap and custom CSS 3 for the design, React for the frontend, Node.js and Express for the backend.
Database - MongoDB.
Hosting - Heroku.
Version control - GitHub. Working (hopefully) version - https://web-20-cent-tech-mern.herokuapp.com/
